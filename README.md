# Why did I make a game engine?
I wanted to know how game engines worked form the inside, and what knowledge you need for making an engine.<br>
As I've expierienced IT IS HARD to make a good workflow of the code in the engine itself, as in how to save objects for rendering, how to render them ect.<br>
But after some time things got flowing and the workflow of the engine came to mind with making list of each individual sprite type, in the end this wasn't the smartest decision I've made yet.<br>
